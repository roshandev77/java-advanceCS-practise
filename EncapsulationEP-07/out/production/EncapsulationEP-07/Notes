Encapsulation --> process of wrapping up the data and the member methods

Why we do this --> We do this for security purposes

We achieve Encap --> by making data member / properties as private

and we access these properties using public methods

private price_laptop;

public void getPrice() {
validations here

if the person is admin then he can get the price or chnage the price and many validations they can keep
return the price
}
