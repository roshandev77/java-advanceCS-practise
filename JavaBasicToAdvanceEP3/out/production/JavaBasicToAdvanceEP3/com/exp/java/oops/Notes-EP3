Object --> It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities.
           A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods.

An object consists of :
       --> State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
       --> Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
       --> Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.



       Param Constructor --> It is defined by the programmer and pass some argument in it.
